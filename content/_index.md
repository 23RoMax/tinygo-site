# TinyGo - A Go Compiler For Small Places

TinyGo is a project to bring the Go programming language to microcontrollers and small systems with a single processor core. It can also be used to produce WebAssembly (WASM) code which is very compact in size.

Just want to see the code? Go to the Github repository at [https://github.com/aykevl/tinygo](https://github.com/aykevl/tinygo).

TinyGo also has support for several different devices such as accelerometers and magnetometers. Check out the Github repository at [https://github.com/aykevl/tinygo-drivers](https://github.com/aykevl/tinygo-drivers) for more information.
