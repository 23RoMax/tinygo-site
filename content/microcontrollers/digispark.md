The [Digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1) is an [ATtiny85](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85) based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller, and a bit less powerful. 

There is very limited support at the moment for this board.

Note: the AVR backend of LLVM is still experimental so you may encounter bugs.
